## Question 2

  Creating an end-to-end claims system for a client is a very big job. The first and most important step is to understand the client’s needs in great detail. This requires a dialogue with the client's employees across their entire claims process to make sure that every nuance of their business is accounted for. A few examples of the many considerations are listed below:

* Are the client's and provider's technologies compatible?
  - Does the client use AWS, Azure or Google Cloud for their storage? The end-to-end solution should be as integrated as possible into the client’s current setup.

* Are vendors being disintermediated?

  - Nationwide's Pet Insurance uses JPMorgan to process claims payments, so policyholders already have accounts there. The end-to-end solution should work with the key vendors that the client wishes to maintain a relationship with.

* Are firm specific idiosyncrasies being accounted for?

  - A P&C insurer in Florida can expect claims volume to spike following a hurricane, is the system built to handle this kind of fluctuation?

* Does the end-to-end system address the needs of the clients?

  - Reducing claim turnaround time at the expense of fraud detection may be an appropriate tradeoff for some clients but not others.


Once the needs of the client are fully understood, modules for each step in the claims process need to be built. While some of it may be as simple as moving technology over to the client, other feautures may need to be built from the ground up. An auto insurer may require pictures of an accident and determination of fault while a pet insurer may require a specific form. Every business is different so there is likely to be at least some customization for each client.  

When the modules for each step in the claims process are built they need to be integrated into the client’s process, this is best done slowly. In addition to the technologies being integrated, the client's employees must also be integrated into the new system. This requires training manuals, technical demonstrations and on call staff to help troubleshoot. The employees are bound to have questions and concerns about the new system and the solution provider needs to earn their support in order to have a successful transition.  

From here, any problems, concern and feedback need to be taken into consideration to improve the system. Things are rarely perfect on the first try and while some of the issues may require further client education, others may need the solutions provider to redevelop and reintegrate.  

Finally after the new end-to-end system has experience both normal and abnormal workflow while operating side-by-side the old system, the old system can be shut down. It is unlikely that the client has just make a onetime purchase of an end-to-end system, it is likely that they were buying a recurring relationship with the solutions provider. As a result, the solution provider must continue to maintain and improve the system when issues arise or the client’s needs change.
