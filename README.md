## Question 2

  Creating an end-to-end claims system for a client is a very big job. The first and most important step is to understand the client’s needs in great detail. This requires dialogue with their employees across the entire claims process to make sure that every nuance to their business is accounted for.

* Are the systems compatible?
  - Does the client use AWS, Azure or Google Cloud for their storage? The end-to-end solution should be as integrated as possible into the client’s current setup.

* Are certain vendors being disintermediated?

  - Nationwide Pet Insurance uses JPMorgan to process payments so policyholders have accounts there. The end-to-end solution should work with the key vendors that the client wishes to maintain a relationship with.

* Are firm specific idiosyncrasies being accounted for?

  - A P&C insurer in Florida can expect claims volume to spike following a hurricane, is the system built to handle this kind of fluctuation is it better equip to handle a consistent flow of claims?

* Is the client looking to improve their claim turnaround time or do they have a greater need to improve their fraud detection capabilities.

  - Speeding up an already low turnaround time at the expense of fraud detection may not be appropriate for some clients for whom fraud is the bigger issue.


Once the needs of the client are fully understood, modules for each step in their claims process need to be built. Maybe some of it is simply moving Trupanion technology and methods over to the client, while other pieces may need to be built entirely from the ground up. An auto insurer may require pictures of an accident and determination of fault while a pet insurer may only require a convenient form.

 When the modules are complete they need to be integrated into the client’s process, this is probably best done one step at a time and very slowly. The technologies and systems need to be compatible with the client’s.  Another critical aspect of this integration is training the client’s employees on the new system. The client is bound to have questions on the new system and the solution provider needs to have representatives available to offer assistance and troubleshoot.

 Problems, concern and feedback need to be taken into consideration from here. Things are rarely perfect on the first try and while some of the issues may require further client education, others may require the solutions provider to makes changes to the process and reintegrate.  

Finally after the new end-to-end system has experience normal and abnormal workflow while operating side by side the old system, the old system can be shut down. It is unlikely that the client was just making a onetime purchase of a system, they were probably buying a continuous relationship with the solutions provider. As a result, the solution provider must maintain and improve the process over time as issues arise or the client’s needs change.
